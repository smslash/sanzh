					<h2>King</h2>
					<p>The King is the most important piece in chess. If the king is trapped so that its capture is unavoidable, the game is over and that player loses. The king has little mobility, so it is also considered one of the weakest pieces in the game. The king can move to any adjacent square. That is, it can move one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It cannot move onto a square occupied by a piece of the same color. The king captures another piece in the same way it moves, by landing on the square of the opposing piece. There is an additional limit on the movement of the king. The king may not move to a square which would put the king under attack by an opposing piece (called in “check”). As a result of this limit, two kings may never stand next to each other - since moving next to the opposing king would put the moving king into check. The king can also be forced to move or capture if the king is under attack (“check”) and the only way to stop the attack is to move the king.</p>

				<h2>Queen</h2>
				<p>The Queen is considered the most powerful piece on the board. It can move any number of squares in a straight line - either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The queen moves like the rook and bishop combined. Unless capturing, the queen must move to an unoccupied square; and it cannot jump over pieces. The queen captures on the same path it moves, by landing on the square of the opposing piece.</p>

			<div class="title">
				<h2>Rook</h2>
				<p>The rook moves in a straight line either horizontally or vertically through any number of unoccupied squares, until it reaches the end of board or it is blocked by another piece. It cannot jump over other pieces. The rook captures on the same path it moves, by occupying the square on which an enemy piece stands. The rook can land on any square on the board, therefore it is one of the more powerful pieces on the board.</p>

			<div class="title">
				<h2>Bishop</h2>
				<p>The Bishop moves in a straight line diagonally on the board. It can move as many squares as wanted, until it meets the end of the board or another piece. The bishop cannot jump over other pieces. The bishop captures on the same path it moves, by landing on the square of the opposing piece. Because of the way the bishop moves, the piece always remains on the same color squares it started on. Each player begins with two bishops, one on the black-colored and one on the white-colored squares. They are frequently referred to as the “dark-squared” bishop and “light-squared” bishop. The bishops can also be named according to the side they begin on - king's bishop and queen's bishop.</p>

				<h2>Knight</h2>
				<p>The Knight is the most special piece in chess, having a flexibility that makes it a powerful piece. The knight is the only piece on the board that may jump over other pieces. The knight moves two squares horizontally or vertically and then one more square at a right-angle. The knight’s move is shaped as an “L”. The knight always lands on a square opposite in color from its initial square. The knight can jump over pieces of either color while going to its destination square, but it does not capture any pieces it jumps over. The knight captures by landing on the square of the opposing piece. The knight cannot land on a square occupied by a piece of the same color. Since the knight's movement is not in a straight line, it can attack a queen, bishop, or rook without being reciprocally attacked by that piece.</p>

				<h2>Pawn</h2>
				<p>The pawn is the most numerous and the least powerful piece on the chessboard. Pawns are unusual in their movement. Generally the pawn moves forward only, one square at a time. An exception is the first time a pawn is moved, it may move forward two squares. The pawn cannot jump over other pieces; any piece directly in front of a pawn blocks its advance to that square. The pawn is the only piece that cannot move backward. The pawn is also the only piece that does not capture in the same way that it moves. The pawn captures an opposing piece by moving diagonally one square - it cannot capture by moving straight ahead.</p>
